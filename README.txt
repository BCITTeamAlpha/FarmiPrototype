The character currently being controlled is designated by a little orange block floating above/beside them. This block also serves as a reticle for aiming.
The UI on the bottom left is coloured the same colour as the player who is currently taking their turn.
Each turn is broken up into 3 phases: Movement, Aiming, and Firing
In the movement phase you have 20 seconds to move, jump, and pickup weapons. If you run out of time the phase ends.
In the aiming phase you cannot move but have 10 seconds to angle your shot and fire your weapon. If you run out of time your turn ends.
If you fire your weapon before the time runs out, the turn will not pass until the bullet has hit something.
